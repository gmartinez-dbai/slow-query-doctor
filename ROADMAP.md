## v0.1.x - Polish & Bug Fixes (November 2025)

**Focus:** Improve v1 based on real user feedback

- [x] Add better sample outputs showing diverse query patterns
- [x] Improve recommendation quality (distinguish between missing indexes, query rewrites, schema changes)
- [x] Add more detailed explanations for why queries are slow
- [x] Handle edge cases in log parsing (multi-line queries, special characters)
- [x] Add support for different PostgreSQL log formats (plain, CSV, JSON)
- [x] Improve error messages and user guidance
- [x] Add configuration file support (.slowquerydoctor.yml)
